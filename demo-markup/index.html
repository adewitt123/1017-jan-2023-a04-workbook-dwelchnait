       <h2> Champions League Quarter Finals</h2>
        <p>A strange enough start, though. Mitroglou prances down the Benficaright and fires a low cross into the Bayern box. It is a decent delivery, but there is nobody there to take a shot on goal. Bayern clear, and Ribery dances down the left again. He feeds Douglas Costa down the channel. Douglas Costa stands one up to the far post, and Vidal heads home into the right-hand portion of the net with the greatest of ease from six yards!</p>
